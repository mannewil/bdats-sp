Semester work for Data Structures subject. Presented as-is.

Bit more info:
# Double List 
1) This was the first semester work. Make a structure called AbstrDoubleList, implement requested functions.
2) Make the rest of the program, so that it would work with data. (Save/load to/from file, generate, add new, remove...)

# Binary Search Tree
1) This was the second. Make a structure of Binary Search Tree, implement requested functions.
2) Make the rest of the program, ensure that it could read the supplied data containing many coordinates and names of various monuments. This file isn't supplied.

# Heap
1) This was the last. Does the heap, sort of it, and so on.
2) The program was basically a modified BST, though I got lazy and didn't bother with doing more than just the structure. I got less points, but still beat the exam.
